1. Run server
   eclipse->file->export->Java->Runnable JAR file-> 
	Launch configuration = LaunchServer 
	Export destination = code file
	Name jar = server.jar
	Package required libraries into generated JAR

   terminal-> java -jar server.jar /path/to/items.txt

2. Run client
   eclipse->file->export->Java->Runnable JAR file-> 
	Launch configuration = LaunchClient
	Export destination = code file
	Name jar = client.jar
	Package required libraries into generated JAR

   terminal-> java -jar client.jar $(cat auct_name) <bidderName>

Note:
	Now the jars contain both the server and client code, which is not a good thing in general
